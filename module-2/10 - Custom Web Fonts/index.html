                    <h1>We said goodbye.</h1>
                    <blockquote>    
                        <p>
                            I watched the cab out of sight. I went back up the steps and into the bedroom and pulled the bed to pieces and remade it. There was a long dark hair on one of the pillows. There was a lump of lead at the pit of my stomach.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The French have a phrase for it. The bastards have a phrase for everything and they are always right.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To say goodbye is to die a little.
                        </p>
