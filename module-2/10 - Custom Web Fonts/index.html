            We said goodbye.

            I watched the cab out of sight. I went back up the steps and into the bedroom and pulled the bed to pieces and remade it. There was a long dark hair on one of the pillows. There was a lump of lead at the pit of my stomach.

            The French have a phrase for it. The bastards have a phrase for everything and they are always right.

            To say goodbye is to die a little.
