                <h1>Horizontal Scroll Widget</h1>
                <p>In most cases, our job as responsive web developers is to make sure our content doesn't overflow its container (let alone the viewport).</p>
                <p>But what if we're making an online shop and want to build a widget that suggests similar products? We might decide that we want to let our users scroll through a catalogue, but don't want it to take up as much room as everything in a search results or product category page. This is where horizontal scroll widgets come in.</p>
